ASSIGNMENTS AND PROJECTS

NB: You are free to collaborate with your colleagues or use external resources to solve assignments and projects. The tutors will only provide extra guidance and clarity when needed, but they will not provide you with explicit answers or solutions; that is your burden as a trainee. Always remember, Google is your friend, and there is no greater university than YouTube.
